# Taiga VSCode Theme

A theme for VSCode with light and dark themes.

## Suggested Settings
These are just settings that I like, you don't have to do any of this:
```jsonc
// I like monospace fonts that have ligatures and cursive italics.
"editor.fontFamily": "MonoLisa, Dank Mono",
// Organise the UI, put the main sidebar on the right and position the activity bar bellow.
"workbench.sideBar.location": "right",
"workbench.secondarySideBar.defaultVisibility": "hidden",
"workbench.activityBar.location": "bottom",
// Hide various other UI things so that the editor is clear and has as much space as possible.
"editor.stickyScroll.enabled": false,
"window.customTitleBarVisibility": "never",
"workbench.layoutControl.enabled": false,
"editor.minimap.enabled": false,
"workbench.editor.showTabs": "none"
```
