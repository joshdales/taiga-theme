# Taiga VSCode Theme

A theme for VSCode. Built with a font that has cursive italics in mind, works great with [MonoLisa](https://www.monolisa.dev/)
or [Dank Mono](https://philpl.gumroad.com/l/dank-mono).

## Example Settings
Coding-specific fonts that have a cursive variant and/or ligatures
```json
"editor.fontFamily": "MonoLisa, Dank Mono, JetBrains Mono, Victor Mono",
```
Personally I use `MonoLisa` with the following settings:
```json
"editor.fontLigatures": "'ss02' on, 'calt' on, 'liga' on, 'zero' on",
```

Other VSCode settings:
```json
"editor.guides.bracketPairs": "active",
"window.commandCenter": true,
```

If you want a slack theme based on this then I recommend:
```
#0D141F,#2C3849,#375380,#DCDEE0,#283D5D,#DCDEE0,#3ED07E,#1A283D,#1A283D,#DCDEE0
```
